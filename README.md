# AI-Driven Personalized Portfolio Rebalancing Using Reinforcement Learning
A Scalable and Constraint-Aware Framework for Dynamic Wealth Management via Game-Theoretic Optimization
As a VIP client at a major bank, I work with a broker who manages my investments and retirement fund. We regularly review my financial plan - looking at projections, asset allocations, and ways to reach long-term goals. The service feels personal, and many banks offer similar wealth planning tools.
However, most of these systems still rely on fixed, rule-based templates. They rarely adapt to an individual's real profile or adjust quickly when markets shift or life events occur. They miss the chance to use modern machine learning - especially reinforcement learning (RL) - to update strategies dynamically in real time.
This paper introduces an AI-powered portfolio rebalancing system that uses RL to tailor decisions to each client's goals while staying within strict risk, liquidity, and tax limits. At its core is a neural primal–dual framework: an Actor proposes portfolio adjustments, while a dual Critic (λ) enforces constraints in real time. Their interaction ensures every action is both optimized and feasible. A Stackelberg-style behavior model then predicts how clients respond - some act immediately, others delay - so recommendations are not only ideal but also practical.
We evaluate this approach against a standard 60/40 rule-based strategy and a vanilla PPO agent. Metrics such as goal achievement, constraint adherence, and response time show clear improvements. Removing either the dual constraint layer or the behavior model reduces performance by 15–30%, confirming both are critical to success.
